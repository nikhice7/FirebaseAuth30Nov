This is the 2nd part of the EC601 HW2.

A new app is created with interface with firebase cloud database implementation.

- Home page provides user registration and an option for already registered user to move to login page

- If user is on login page, an option is provided for users to go back to registration page as well as to login into their existing account

- Third screen allows user to key in their name and address. They can save their data which is stored in Firebase Project database. Logout feature is also implemented.
